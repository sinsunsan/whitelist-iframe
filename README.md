whitelist iframe
================

An example Discourse plugin for whitelisting iframe urls

Usage
=====

Fork this repository and add the urls that you wish to whitelist to `assets/javascripts/lib/discourse-markdown/whitelist-iframe.js.es6`.
For older versions of Discourse, you may need to add the whitelisted urls to `assets/javascripts/iframe-whitelist.js` instead.
